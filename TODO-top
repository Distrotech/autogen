* In Progress

** create an internal 'tr' function.  There are insoluable
   incompatibilities between the various implementations.
   I don't want to configure it :(.
** write some autoconf magic to find out whether it is safe to add
   O_BINARY to [f[re]]open calls, and fix up calls in body of code.
** Write an argv style parsing agPrint.c
*** Need to add compat/snprintf.c and replace use of sprintf w/ snprintf
    throughout!  This really needs to support %n$ notation too =/O|
*** ANSI format specifiers: cdeEfgGiosuxX with conversion quals h and l

* Pending

** new arg for setting time of output files
** Use compat.h vararg/stdarg macros.
** need to write a compat/strcspn.c and add AC_REPLACE_FUNC(strcspn).
** when the dust has settled on glibc-2, try an AXP build against it.  Autogen
   exposes some (well, one, at least) bugs in Digital's libc.
** Rework the shell string processing in the definitions file so
   that backquoted text is immediately passed to the shell and
   then concatenated with the surrounding text.  This will require
   constructing arrays of string pointers and knowing whether they
   point to contiguous source text or to allocated memory.
** Try to sort out the server chaining stuff once and for all... I
   suspect the pipeline will need to be built up in reverse like bash...
** Need to add compat/alloca.c, or else use byacc instead of bison for
   distribution (bison parsers rely on a working alloca -- yeuck!!)
   Let's use byacc!!
  - Macro: AC_FUNC_ALLOCA
     This macro does not try to get `alloca' from the System V R3
     `libPW' or the System V R4 `libucb' because those libraries
     contain some incompatible functions that cause trouble.  Some
     versions do not even contain `alloca' or contain a buggy version.
     If you still want to use their `alloca', use `ar' to extract
     `alloca.o' from them instead of compiling `alloca.c'.

*  Possibilities for the (distant) future:

** implement _FOR x IN a, b, c, ...
** rewrite in guile (instead of C)
** parse the autogen macros with a guile translator
** write code for "autogetopt" (GNU getopt), or
  possibly the new glibc argp parser.
