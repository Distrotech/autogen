* Known Bugs

** There is a bug in the regex library config code, where the macros for
   determining whether a posix regcomp/regexec are present, and whether
   the user has specified a library explicity with --with-regex-prefix
   (et. al.) don't cooperate, so you don't always get the option you ask
   for.   We should test for user specified libraries first, and then
   test those for POSIX compliance with the other macros, falling back to
   the included regex files if these tests fail.

* In Progress

*** Need to replace use of sprintf w/ snprintf throughout!
*** ANSI format specifiers: ceEfgG with conversion quals h and l
*** rewrite expressions to use Guile (instead of the reverse
    polish stuff originally hacked together :)

* Pending

** new arg for setting time of output files
** need to write a compat/strcspn.c and add AC_REPLACE_FUNC(strcspn).
** All errors from autogen/getdefs etc. should start with,
   `options.pzProgName' (aka 'basename(argv[0])').

*  Possibilities for the (distant) future:

** implement _FOR x IN a, b, c, ...
** write code for "autogetopt" (GNU getopt), or
  possibly the new glibc argp parser.
