** noag-boot.sh needs to really work when autogen is not available.

** All errors from getdefs and columns should start with,
   `options.pzProgName' (aka 'basename(argv[0])').

** Change the invocations of getdefs to send output to stdout in
   preference to invoking autogen internally.  The current method is ugly.
