* Use compat.h vararg/stdarg macros.
* Convert my (Gary's) code to match your (Bruce's) coding style.
  (Stroustrup's style, actually)
* need to write a compat/strcspn.c and add AC_REPLACE_FUNC(strcspn).
* persuade FSF to patch autoconf so that the AC_CHECK_TYPE(id_t) code doesn't
  pick up `pid_t` (just a change to the regular expression), then fix
  compat/sigsend.c to use id_t.
* when the dust has settled on glibc-2, try an AXP build against it.  Autogen
  exposes some (well, one, at least) bugs in Digital's libc.
* Rework the shell string processing in the definitions file so
  that backquoted text is immediately passed to the shell and
  then concatenated with the surrounding text.  This will require
  constructing arrays of string pointers and knowing whether they
  point to contiguous source text or to allocated memory.
* ANSI format specifiers: cdeEfgGiosuxX with conversion quals h and l
