* In Progress

*** ANSI format specifiers for snprintv: ceEfgG with conversion quals h and l

* Pending

** noag-boot.sh needs to really work when autogen is not available.

** All errors from getdefs and columns should start with,
   `options.pzProgName' (aka 'basename(argv[0])').

** Change the invocations of getdefs to send output to stdout in
   preference to invoking autogen internally.  The current method is ugly.

** How about writing a function, (set-cl-option "text")
   grep for ``/\*=gfunc [a-z]'' in the sources for an example
   of how to do that.  THEN:
   
      [= AutoGen5 Template
         (set-cl-option "<option-description>")
      =]

*  Possibilities for the (distant) future:

** implement [= FOR x IN a, b, c, ... =]
** write code for "autogetopt" (GNU getopt), or
  possibly the new glibc argp parser.
