* Known Bugs

** There is a bug in the regex library config code, where the macros for
   determining whether a posix regcomp/regexec are present, and whether
   the user has specified a library explicity with --with-regex-prefix
   (et. al.) don't cooperate, so you don't always get the option you ask
   for.   We should test for user specified libraries first, and then
   test those for POSIX compliance with the other macros, falling back to
   the included regex files if these tests fail.

** expOutput.c needs to export "outputShutdown(bool keep)

** getdefs leaves a NUL at the end of the database file

** memfrob(3GNU) as a function

* In Progress

*** ANSI format specifiers: ceEfgG with conversion quals h and l

* Pending

** augment AutoGen defs with XML.
** need to write a compat/strcspn.c and add AC_REPLACE_FUNC(strcspn).
** All errors from autogen/getdefs etc. should start with,
   `options.pzProgName' (aka 'basename(argv[0])').
** Change the invocations of getdefs to send output to stdout in
   preference to invoking autogen internally.  The current method is ugly.

*  Possibilities for the (distant) future:

** implement [= FOR x IN a, b, c, ... =]
** write code for "autogetopt" (GNU getopt), or
  possibly the new glibc argp parser.
