* new arg for setting time of output files
* Use compat.h vararg/stdarg macros.
* need to write a compat/strcspn.c and add AC_REPLACE_FUNC(strcspn).
* persuade FSF to patch autoconf so that the AC_CHECK_TYPE(id_t) code doesn't
  pick up `pid_t` (just a change to the regular expression), then fix
  compat/sigsend.c to use id_t.
* when the dust has settled on glibc-2, try an AXP build against it.  Autogen
  exposes some (well, one, at least) bugs in Digital's libc.
* Rework the shell string processing in the definitions file so
  that backquoted text is immediately passed to the shell and
  then concatenated with the surrounding text.  This will require
  constructing arrays of string pointers and knowing whether they
  point to contiguous source text or to allocated memory.
* ANSI format specifiers: cdeEfgGiosuxX with conversion quals h and l
* Write an argv style parsing agPrint.c
* Try to sort out the server chaining stuff once and for all... I
  suspect the pipeline will need to be built up in reverse like bash...
* Use the libtool versioning stuff for libopts
* release doesn't perform a proper in situ build sanity check because it
  works from the current source tree, rather than a tree built from the
  distribution tarball... this should be fixed.

#  Possibilities for the (distant) future:

* implement _FOR x IN a, b, c, ...
* rewrite in guile (instead of C)
* parse the autogen macros with a guile translator
* write a general definition extraction tool (a la src/makedefs.sh)
* write code for "autogetopt" (GNU getopt), or
  possibly the new glibc argp parser.
