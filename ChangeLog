	* Makefile.am: added rule for making packages in the pkg directory
	* agen5/defReduce.c: allocation counts assumed 4 byte pointers
	* agen5/expGuile.c: gh_scm2newstr takes a size_t* argument, not int*
	* lcl-ag/agen5/funcFor.c: ditto
	* agen5/opts.def: only evaluate the AG_* assignments
	* autoopts/enumeration.c(optionEnumerationVal): the result must be
	a pointer sized int.
	* autoopts/save.c(optionSaveFile): when putting a pointer into a
	scalar, ensure the scalar is as wide as a pointer.
	* pkg/...: make packaging rules for Sun
	* pkg/libopts/README: cleanup
	* snprintfv/compat.h: undefine _STR and _CONC in case of conflict
	* snprintfv/printf.c: allocate more than we need for our purposes.
	This is still an snprintfv bug....
