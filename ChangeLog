2007-11-04  Bruce Korb  <bkorb@gnu.org>

	* agen5/funcCase.c (compile_re): make the pattern argument
	"char const *" because it does not modify the string, but
	coerce it into "char *" because that is what "regcomp" uses.
	* autoopts/autoopts.h (AGFREE): coerce the argument into being
	deallocatable.
	* autoopts/install-options-h (#include): the ending file name is
	now "stdio.h", not "sys/types.h".
	* autoopts/load.c (insertProgramPath): coerce the pointer to be
	deallocated into "void *" from "char const *".

2007-10-27  Bruce Korb  <bkorb@gnu.org>

	* autoopts/test/getopt.test (compile_getopt): make sure that
	only temporary variations of the option templates are used.
	* autoopts/usage.tpl (flags): make sure these all refer to things
	inside of the testing directory.  Nothing installed.

	should get generated during the build process.

	opening parenthesis for their argument list.
	* config/libopts.def (do-first): check for strsignal function.
	* configure.in (AC_CHECK_FUNCS): don't check for strsignal here

2007-09-08  Bruce Korb  <bkorb@gnu.org>

	* autoopts/save.c (optionSaveFile): If an option is in "disabled" state
	because it was selected via an alias, then emit the name of the alias
	option into the generated config file instead of faulting.

2007-08-04  Bruce Korb  <bkorb@gnu.org>

	* autoopts/autoopts.c (optionProcess): re-call the translation
	procedure if: we have one, translations are active, we did not
	translate option names before config processing, and we need to
	before command line option processing.
	* autoopts/configfile.c (validateOptionsStruct): if we are not to
	translate option names for the command line, then we are also not
	to translate for config time either.
	* autoopts/optcode.tpl (translate_option_strings): rework it so that
	option names are only translated when the OPTPROC_NXLAT_OPT_CFG
	flag bit is turned off.

	comment for any options with "translators" defined.
	* autoopts/proc-state.def (bit[16]): define option name translation

	* autoopts/getopt.tpl: use it
	* autoopts/optlib.tpl: use it, when the usage text string is empty
	* autoopts/optcode.tpl (OPTPROC_X_LAT_USAGE): remove -- not needed
	* autoopts/opthead.tpl (version): reorder it

2007-07-14  Bruce Korb  <bkorb@gnu.org>

	* VERSION: Going to revision 30 of the interface.
	* agen5/loadPseudo.c (doSuffixSpec): require that there be something
	after the '=' marker in a suffix specification.  Make sure any
	allocated memory is deallocatable.
	* agen5/tpProcess.c (processTemplate): deallocate the file name format
	string, if necessary.
	* autoopts/optcode.tpl (full-usage): new
	(short-usage): new -- make it optional to have the full usage text

	pzShortUsage
	* autoopts/optlib.tpl(usage-text): new macro for producing the text.
	* autoopts/proc-state.def (bit): bit numbers must not ever wiggle, so
	fix them all.
	* autoopts/test/nls.test: augment for translatable usage text.

	computed usage text.

	* *EVERYWHERE*: update licensing terms to GPLv3

2007-05-28  Bruce Korb  <bkorb@gnu.org>

	* agen5/schemedef.scm (make-header-guard): remove
	* agen5/expOutput.c (ag_scm_make_header_guard): written in C.
	Will not put multiple underscored together.
	* agen5/expString.c: code cleanup
	* options/options.tpl: make sure no two options use the same flag char.
	* snprintfv/printf.c: remove excessive logic nesting.

	* autoopts/getopt.tpl: include stdio.h and string.h and #define a value
	for DIRCH, setting it to '/' normally, but '\\' for Windows.

2007-04-28  Bruce Korb  <bkorb@gnu.org>

	* config/libopts.def (optional_args): new configurable.  Default
	is enabled, so users must specify, --disable-optional-args to
	disable optional arguments to command line options.
	NO_OPTIONAL_OPT_ARGS is #defined if this is specified.
	* autoopts/optcode.tpl (version):
	Set the --version option flags to different values, depending upon
	whether NO_OPTIONAL_OPT_ARGS is defined or not.  --version will not
	take an argument if this is undefined.
	* autoopts/options_h.tpl (OPTST_ARG_OPTIONAL):
	Set to zero if NO_OPTIONAL_OPT_ARGS is defined.  i.e. never set this
	bit when client code is compiled with --disable-optional-args
	* autoopts/version.c (printVersion): If the caller was compiled with
	NO_OPTIONAL_OPT_ARGS defined, then default to a plain version-only
	output.

	detect conflicting flag values.
	* compat/windows-config.h: also include limits.h
	* config/confmacs.tpl: cleanups
	* getdefs/gdinit.c (validateOptions): set a name if --srcfile or
	--linenum are not specified or are specified with an empty string.
	* getdefs/getdefs.c (doPreamble): do the same thing for --filelist

2007-04-14  Bruce Korb  <bkorb@gnu.org>

	* autoopts/autoopts.c (doPresets): Check for a "save_opts" option.
	If present, the next option is the load opts option.  When doing presets,
	check for a disablement and do not load files or enviornment presets
	if --no-load-opts has been specified.  General cleanup of LOAD_OPTS
	environment variable handling.
	* autoopts/autoopts.h: add some new exit codes: EX_NOINPUT, EX_SOFTWARE
	and EX_CONFIG.
	* autoopts/configfile.c: use a couple of these for "config file not
	found" (EX_NOINPUT) and "you did not pass a valid option def structure"
	(EX_CONFIG).
	* autoopts/environment.c (checkEnvOpt): process one option specific
	environment variable.  (doEnvPresets): call that routine for
	${PROGNAME_LOAD_OPTS} also.
	* autoopts/usage.c (optionUsage): implement "usage" option (triggered
	when "usage_exit_code" is set to EX_USAGE).
	* autoopts/options_h.tpl (sysexits.h): conditionally include this
	* autoopts/install-options-h: strip out the conditional "sysexits.h"
	inclusion and insert the include directly, if present.
	* autoopts/options.tpl (usage-opt): new attribute used to trigger
	addition of "usage" option.  Implement "usage" option.
	* autoopts/optcode.tpl: Implement "usage" option.
	* autoopts/opthead.tpl: Implement "usage" option.
	* autoopts/optlib.tpl:  Implement "usage" option.

2007-03-24  Bruce Korb  <bkorb@gnu.org>

	* agen5/directive.tpl: disable "inline" from generated code.  The CVS
	version of GCC objects to some constructs.  Also, hide output from
	"make"
	* agen5/fsm-macro.tpl: Some compilers feel uncomfortable using the
	"address of" operator on a procedure, so do not generate the dispatch
	table with that operator.
	* agen5/defParse-fsm.c: regenerate
	* agen5/tpLoad.c (loadMacros): use the "z" size modifier for size_t
	format arguments

2007-03-19  Stepan Kasal  <kasal@ucw.cz>

	was overlooked several years ago. :(
	* autoopts/usage-txt.def (AtMost): fix the string
	* config/bootstrap.local (config_versions): bootstrap debian packaging
	* pkg/mkpkg.debian: new
	* pkg/debian/*: new
	* pkg/mkpkg.sh: check for debian packaging tools & use 'em if found.

2007-02-03  Bruce Korb  <bkorb@gnu.org>

	* agen5/tpLoad.c (findFile): add a "pzReferrer" argument.  The
	dirname from that string is now used for searching for files.
	That directory is used after the current dir and before the search
	list.
	(loadTemplate): also needs a referrer argument to pass through to
	the findFile function.
	* agen5/*.*: fix findFile & loadTemplate calls
	* autoopts/load.c (optionMakePath): accept "$@" to mean pkgdatadir
	* autoopts/Makefile.am (libopts_la_CFLAGS): define to:
	-DPKGDATADIR='"$(pkgdatadir)"'

	* autoopts/nested.c (scanXmlEntry): do not include closing '>' in val
	* */Makefile.am: mark with .NOTPARALLEL
	* autoopts/test/defs.in: make GREP, EGREP and FGREP configurable
	* */test/*.test: use these instead of fixed name commands
	* autoopts/makeshell.c (optionParseShell): using a configurable in
	a generated script is pretty pointless -- especially for code intended
	to be removed.  Therefore, emit a plain, vanilla "grep" command.
	* config/misc.def: special Debian dispensation: avoid using
	"guile-config" to derive version since they do not use any standard
	configuration tools.  Use "dpkg" to determine the Guile version.
	use AC_PROG_GREP et al. for $(GREP) variables.

2007-01-17  Bruce Korb  <bkorb@gnu.org>

	* autoopts/makeshell.c (optionParseShell): grep for environment variables
	that start a line in the "env" output, not just anywhere
	* autoopts/test/shell.test: adjust
	* autoopts/autoopts.h (tOptionLoadMode): moved from option_h.tpl
	(option_load_mode): new global
	* autoopts/configfile.c (configFileLoad): propagate the string scan
	mode via a global since it disappears going through an indirect call.
	(handleStructure): use that global.
	* autoopts/load.c (loadOptionLine): use the global
	* autoopts/nested.c: use the global
	* autoopts/options_h.tpl (tOptionLoadMode): do not externalize

	* agen5/tpProcess.c (processTemplate): NULL out the last scheme command
	on "problem" exit, as the command has finished successfully.
	* autoopts/options.tpl (must-set): disallow both "min" and "must-set"
	for one option.  A non-zero "min" implies that it must be set, though
	the converse is not true.
	* autoopts/options_h.tpl (optDesc): mark as "const" the constant fields.
	* autoopts/save.c (printEntry): an option can be marked as "disabled" if
	it was selected by an equivalenced option.  Select option name carefully.
