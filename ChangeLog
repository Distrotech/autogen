        * autoopts/usage.tpl: sometimes (on a Mac?), the option in error is
	not reproduced, so the sed-it-away expression doesn't match.
	* agen5/test/error.test: cope with guile 1.6.4 error messages
	* autoopts/configfile.c (handleStructure): correct the place where
	the argument type is found.
	* autoopts/usage.tpl: sometimes (when?) the bad option is not printed.
