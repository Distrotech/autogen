	* agen5/autogen.c(inner_main): call new aggregated cleanup function
	(signalSetup): When debugging is enabled, use default handling for
	SIGBUS and SIGSEGV.  We may need the core dump.
	* agen5/*.[ch]: change the name of the template struct field from
	pzFileName to pzTplFile.
	* agen5/bootstrap.dir(-Taginfo): "opts.def" may be in a srcdir
	different from builddir during an actual build.
	* agen5/defLoad.c(readDefines): use a stack local variable.
	* agen5/funcCase.c(mUnload_Select): this is now an unloadable macro.
	It must free any regex allocations.
	* agen5/funcDef.c(mUnload_Define): "define" is also unloadable.
	(mLoad_Define): make new templates consistently.
	* agen5/tpLoad.c(loadMacros): make new templates consistently.
	(loadTemplate): ditto
	(templateFixup): obsolete
	(cleanup): new function.  Ensures all templates are unloaded, be they
	defined macros or template files.
	* agen5/functions.tpl(unload-proc): doc those macros that have unload
	functions defined.
	* agen5/tpParse.c(parseTemplate): when displaying content, remember that
	the "select" macro codes are outside the range of names.
	* agen5/test/error.test: srcdir != builddir problem
	* autoopts/optcode.tpl: declare the library first-option global pointers
	* autoopts/opthead.tpl: If we are building for a library, then be certain
	that there is one "lib-name" defined and use it in the definition of
	the DESC() macro.  Otherwise, do the normal thing.
	* config/bootstrap.local(Makefile.am): do a move-if-changed thing.

2006-01-20  Bruce Korb  <bkorb@gnu.org>

	* autoopts/opthead.tpl(library): handle the DESC macro specially for
	library type "programs".
	* autoopts/text_mmap.c(text_mmap): mmap flags must always, always, always
	include either MAP_PRIVATE or MAP_SHARED.  I  removed "SHARED" from
	the list, so now I add PRIVATE.
	* config/bootstrap: make sure ${MISSING} is executable and make the
	"out of date" message more understandable.
	* doc/autogen-texi.txt: describe library option handling.
	
2006-01-08  Bruce Korb  <bkorb@gnu.org>

	* agen5/test/Makefile.am(defs): use file built in autoopts/test dir.
	* agen5/test/defs.in: obsolete
	* autoopts/test/defs.in: make certain the AGexe, GDexe and CLexe env
	variables have full paths.  Rework some functions so they work in the
	agen5/test directory also.  Especially "compile".
	* agen5/test/fmemopen.test: use rewritten compile macro
	* agen5/test/license.test: ditto
	* agen5/test/shell.test: ditto
	* agen5/test/string.test: ditto
	* autoopts/test/argument.test: ditto
	* autoopts/test/keyword.test: ditto
	* autoopts/test/rc.test: ditto
	* xml2ag/test/Makefile.am: 'testdir' is always the testing subdirectory.

2006-01-05  Bruce Korb  <bkorb@gnu.org>

	= 5.8.1 Released

	* agen5/test/defs.in: set AGexe/GDexe/CLexe to full paths & export
	* autoopts/options.tpl: display more information on failure

2005-12-12  Bruce Korb  <bkorb@gnu.org>

	* agen5/expExtract.c(buildEmptyText): clean it up.
	* autoopts/options.tpl(version-text): new global used in two places
	* autoopts/optlib.tpl: one of them
	* autoopts/opthead.tpl: the other
	* autoopts/optmain.tpl: fix bug in range-option-code (it must always be)
	* autoopts/putshell.c(optionPutShell): "val" is a uintptr_t, so specify
	"ld" and "lX" in the format strings.  "icc" still doesn't like it.
	* autoopts/version.c(printVersion): if we have no pzFullVersion, then
	pull the first line of the usage title.
	* */opts.def(package): add this with "GNU AutoGen" to all option defs.

2005-12-08  Bruce Korb  <bkorb@gnu.org>

	* autoopts/text_mmap.c(text_mmap): anonymous pages should not be
	shared.  Some platforms will seg fault on that.
	* agen5/expGuile.c(ag_scm_c_eval_string_from_file_line):
	Guile 1.4.x does not know about scm_open_input_string().
	* autoopts/enumeration.c(optionKeywordName): new.  Map enumeration value
	to the string name.
	(optionEnumerationVal): accommodate this and validate the enum value.
	* autoopts/optlib.tpl(OPT_<optname>_VAL2STR): new macro for invoking
	the new (and private) function above.
	* autoopts/test/keyword.test(keyword_2): new test for this.
	* doc/autogen-texi.txt: doc it.
