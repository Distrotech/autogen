THIS TARBALL IS NOT A FULL DISTRIBUTION.

The contents of this tarball is designed to be incorporated into
software packages that utilize the AutoOpts option automation
package and are intended to be installed on systems that may not
have libopts installed.

Usage Instructions for autoconf/automake/libtoolized projects:

1. Install the unrolled tarball into your package source tree
2. Add ''${tag}'' to the list of subdirectories to build
3. Add ''${tag}/Makefile'' to the list of configured files
4. Move libopts.m4 to your autoconf macro directory
5. Add ''INVOKE_LIBOPTS_MACROS'' to your configure.ac file.

If your package does not utilize the auto* tools, then you
will need to hand craft the rules for building the library.
