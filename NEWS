New in 5.5.5 - May, 2003
* More improvements in man page appearance
* minor bug fixes here and there
* better docs on partitioned ini (rc) files
* updated snprintfv library
* improved handling of errors in CGI processing
* many warning cleanups

New in 5.5.3 - March, 2003
* AutoOpts' usage procedure has been enhanced to produce either AutoOpts
  standard usage or usage that looks more like current GNU practices.
  The latter provides less information and help.
* I32LPx behavior has improved.  Don't think I can call it "industrial
  strength" just yet, tho.

New in 5.5.2 - February, 2003
* Fixes for FreeBSD weirdisms with sed, dlopen(), and the Guile library
* stash offsets in uintptr_t types so this thing works when
  sizeof(void*) != sizeof(off_t)
* still more configury fixes.  It will never, ever end.
