New in __CURRENT_VERSION__ November 2008

* Hierarchically valued options can now be stored with ``--save-opt'' option

* option state may now be "reset".  This is indistinguishable from the
  compiled state.  If option state is "saved" later, such an option will
  not appear in the save file.

* there is a new option argument type:  time.  Its argument string
  represents years (?!), months, weeks, days, hours, minutes and seconds.
  The value seen by the program is an integer number of seconds.
  (This is not a date/time.)  The duration of a year is always 365 days
  and the duration of a month is always 30 days.

* various obscure cleanups.

New in 5.9.4 August 2008

* integer number arguments may now have their values suffixed with
  one of the letters k/K/m/M/g/G/t/T to signify scaling by powers
  of 1000 (lower case) or 1024 (upper case).  Specify, "scaled".

* AutoOpts "arg-type" may now be set to "file".  Existence of the directory
  portion of the name will be checked.  The existence (or not) of the actual
  file may also be checked.  Finally, the file may be pre-opened with either
  "fopen(3C)" or "open(2)".

* The "columns" program now accepts a "--fill" option to cause it to fill
  text instead of filling columns.

* The tests should no longer indirectly reference installed versions of
  the binaries.  They should all work out of the build directories.
