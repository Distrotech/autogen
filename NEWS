New in 5.4.1
* Improved the configurability of the libopts tear-off library.

New in 5.4
* should have bumped to 5.4 with the release of xml2ag.
  AutoOpts documentation and usage text now uses the copyright.eaddr value
  as the "send bug reports to" address.
  AutoGen command line options may now be embedded in template and definitions
  files.  The template files support the scheme function (set-option "..."),
  and definition files support the directive, "#option ...".

New in 5.3.8
* xml2ag was added.  This is a wrapper program that will convert
  XML documentation into AutoGen definitions and pass them through
  to autogen.  It accepts all the AutoGen command line options and
  passes them through, too.

New in 5.0
* Template expressions were made simpler and much more powerful.
  An expression may be AutoGen defined values, shell scripts,
  Scheme expressions, or the latter two formatted with an
  AutoGen definition value.  AutoGen now depends on Guile.

New in 4.5.8
* Finally, finally, finally, really finished the portability issues.

New in 4.5.7
* Finally, finally, really finished the portability issues.

New in 4.5.6
* Finally, really finished the portability issues and it now
  included a complete implementation of the printf family of
  formatting routines.
* Templates for client program man pages and invoking chapters
  for texinfo docs are supplied.  They are also used by the
  autogen/columns/getdefs programs that come in this package.

New in 4.5
* Compiles with cygwin tools, provided you link GNU regex.
* *Much* enhanced portability.  AutoGen really should compile in
  just about any POSIX environment.
* Overhauled the configuration to help programs which want to use
  autoopts from Makefiles.

New in 4.4
* Massively reworked the template parsing in preparation for
  beguiling AutoGen.
* Deleted an ugly shell/awk program and replaced it with
  an ugly C program for extracting definitions from comments. :)

New in 4.1
* Two new string generation functions for creating shell-rule
  quoted strings ("xx...\t") and raw strings ('xxx\nxx')
* single quoted strings in the template macros are now
  processed the same way as in the definitions file.

New in 4.0
* The autoopts package works without the source tree in place.
* Makefile.in is regenerated with automake-1.2
* complete rewrite of the macro definitions.
* changed the code emission and expression processing
  to handle the new data structures
* added another expression function (JOIN)
* changed shell commands to run in a shell server instead
  of starting a new shell each time.  *MUCH* faster.

New in 3.2
* Ported to Digital Unix (AXP).
* ubiquitous bugfixes
* autoconfiscated with automake 1.2
