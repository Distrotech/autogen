New in 5.5.3 - March, 2003
* AutoOpts' usage procedure has been enhanced to produce either AutoOpts
  standard usage or usage that looks more like current GNU practices.
  The latter provides less information and help.
* I32LPx behavior has improved.  Don't think I can call it "industrial
  strength" just yet, tho.

New in 5.5.2 - February, 2003
* Fixes for FreeBSD weirdisms with sed, dlopen(), and the Guile library
* stash offsets in uintptr_t types so this thing works when
  sizeof(void*) != sizeof(off_t)
* still more configury fixes.  It will never, ever end.

New in 5.5 - December 15, 2002
* The FOR macro will now accept a list of values, as in:
  [= FOR v IN one, "two , part" three =]
* snprintfv-0.99f was fully incorporated, saving 300K of distribution
  space and a lot of configure time.
* The 'dne' function will accept "-d" as the first argument in order
  to suppress the date from the output.

New in 5.4.8 - December 10, 2002
* Freed AutoOpts from libguile.  It was never really dependent.
* new snprintfv library incorporated

New in 5.4.4 5.4.3 and 5.4.2
* The libopts.tar.gz file is now installed
* Miscelleaneous option state saving bugs were fixed
* man page templates were cleaned up
* .texi-isms were removed from usage output
* a GCC aliasing bug was fixed.

New in 5.4.1
* Improved the configurability of the libopts tear-off library.

New in 5.4
* AutoOpts documentation and usage text now uses the copyright.eaddr value
  as the "send bug reports to" address.
  AutoGen command line options may now be embedded in template and definitions
  files.  The template files support the scheme function (set-option "..."),
  and definition files support the directive, "#option ...".
