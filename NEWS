New in 5.9.3 - October 2007

* libopts requires strsignal, so the config test has been moved.
* fixed ``--save'' option bug
* programs may now choose to have config files kept in cannonical form
  ("C" locale), even if long option names are translated.  The option
  definition file must contain ``no-xlate = opt-cfg;'' or
  ``no-xlate = opt;''  See the documentation for details.

New in 5.9.2 July 2007

* GNU GPL v3 is now emitted with the "gpl" and "lgpl" functions.
* 
The most work was done for AutoOpts:

* usage.tpl template has been added.
* getopt.tpl uses this template for constructing its usage string.
* if "short-usage" or "full-usage" can be used to specify the form
  of the usage text:
  * not supplied -> compute it at run time
  * supplied, but empty -> use "usage.tpl" to compute it
  * is a variable name -> insert into option structure
  * is text -> emit the text and point to it from option structure
