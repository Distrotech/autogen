* without libxml2, the docs cannot be rebuilt.

New in 5.10 November 2008

* "columns" program takes an option for an end-of-output string
* "autogen" takes a "-MF<dep-file-name>" option producing a dependency
  file that is carefully engineered to be a little bit older than
  any other output file.
* A guile "(string->camelcase)" function has been added.  It removes
  non-alphanumerics and capitalizes the letter after any removals.

New in 5.10 - November 2009

* When an option is configured out (via ifdef or ifndef attributes), it is
  not normally displayed in the usage text. Sometimes, users want to know
  why the option they supplied is against the law ("illegal"). If the option
  has the omitted-usage attribute, the extended usage (via "--help") will
  now show the option name and the text:

    This option has been disabled

  Or, alternately, the text specified with the omitted-usage attribute.

  If the option is specified, the error message will be:

    PROGRAM: The MUMBLE option has been disabled

  followed by the abbreviated usage.

* Option aliasing: Several times it has been necessary to have two different
  options mean exactly the same thing. Usually, this is a consequence of
  some sort of historical use. However it came about, the need is
  there. So, AutoOpts now supports a new option attribute: aliases. This
  option will be listed in the usage text but will be handled exactly as
  if the aliased-to option were specified. You probably shouldn't use it
  unless you have to.
