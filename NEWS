* new stuff

New in 5.11.9 May 2011

* licenses have been moved to separate files.  They are no longer
  hard coded in autogen.  Consequently, clients may add their own.
* BASH-ism fix.

New in 5.11.8 March 2011

* *Really* cope with Guile version number 2.0.
  Some interfaces were "accidentally" removed between
  version 1.9 and 2.0.  Oops.

* AutoOpts argument types of "time and date" have been added
  to the current support for time duration.

* Fixed messup with a data structure.....

New in 5.11.6 February 2011

* Cope with Guile version number 2.0

* XML character encodings are parsed in config files, thus
  <opt-name>...&lt;...</opt-name> yields "...<..."

* exit codes are enumerated for auto-opts projects
  They will appear in an enumeration in the header file and
  in generated documentation.

* program documentation templates have been improved.  See docs.

* packaging information
  The PKGDATADIR and --with-packager... information are now
  compiled into the option structure.  This makes it possible for
  config file searches to look in ${PKGDATADIR} by using "$@/"
  as the lead part of a "homerc" name.  e.g.
     homerc = "$@/config";
  will look for a file named "config" in that directory.
  "help" and "version" information will now include any
  --with-packager stuff.
