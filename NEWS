New in 5.6 - February, 2004
* AutoFSM was enhanced with the notion of a "noop" transition handling
* fmemopen() is now used (when possible) for anonymous output (diversions)
* The Guile function (chdir "...") is now wrapped so AutoGen can adapt
* the definitions parser now uses a FSM parser instead of YACC
* AutoOpt-ed programs can now have internationalized usage text
* Templates have been added for using getopt(3) or getopt_long(3GNU)
  to parse options (in lieu of libopts).

New in 5.5.5 - May, 2003
* better docs on partitioned ini (rc) files

New in 5.5.3 - March, 2003
* AutoOpts' usage procedure has been enhanced to produce either AutoOpts
  standard usage or usage that looks more like current GNU practices.
  The latter provides less information and help.
