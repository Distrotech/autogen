New in __CURRENT_VERSION__ July 2006

* ag-fprintf will now allow you to emit text into a suspended output stream.
* string tables have been implemented as a scheme function.  This makes it
  very easy to produce an array of characters containing NUL termintaed
  strings and have these string offsets (indexes) available for indexing into
  the string arrays.
* The libopts code will omit Windows-unfriendly code if the compile defines
  _WIN32 and does not define __CYGWIN__.
* suffix specifications in the pseudo macro may now construct an output
  file name format string using scheme code, a la:

    [= autogen5 template
    h=(string-append (getenv "TMPDIR") "/%s-hdr.h")  =]

  The "%s" will still be replaced by the base name.
* the scheme function "version-compare" will allow you to compare
  two dotted version numbers.  These can be your own versions or
  that of autogen.  The scheme variable ``autogen-version'' has been
  around for a long time and may be used as one of the arguments.
* #assert is now active in definition files.  If the text begins
  with a back quote, it is handed off to the shell for processing.
  If an open parenthesis, it is handed off to Guile.  If it is
  anything else, it is ignored.

New in 5.8.4 - March 2006

* Day 1 bug in snprintfv: numberd format elements can get mishandled.
* more platform specific variations in test output are handled.
* column 1 apostrophes in generated man page text are now escaped.
* Guile release 1.8.x is accommodated (in progress 3/25/2006)

New in 5.8.3 - February 2006

* Testing cleanups
* To use mmap, you must first mmap more space than used by the file,
  then, if the last bit laps into a page not backed by a file, you have
  to remap that page anonymously.  If you do not first map pages not
  backed by file data, you seg fault trying to remap pages on some systems.
* Make a clean implementation of library option processing.

New in 5.8 - December, 2005

* AutoGen now builds against Guile 1.7.x
* Fixed a small timing hole where the read from the read end of the output
  pipe of the server shell can fail.  (The read is retried.)
* Eliminated the configure code that symlinked all the sources into the
  build directory.
* Added a macro for testing mmap failure to accommodate a picky compiler.
* The minor version number is being bumped.  There is a new (albeit tiny)
  feature being added to the syntax.  See the doc on the pseudo-macro.
* Fixed a bug wherein out-of-order definitions could get mistyped causing
  various catastrophic results.
