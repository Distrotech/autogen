New in __CURRENT_VERSION__ February 2013

* "for-each" main procedures may now be specified as processing
  standard input as a data file instead of being replacement
  operands.  Users can always have "stdin" treated as data by using
  a single hyphen on the command line.

* configuration fixes.

* larger blocks of help text are now broken down into paragraphs
  when NLS support has been specified.  These paragraphs are also
  emitted into an xgettext extractable form so translators have
  matching text to work from.

New in 5.17.1 January, 2013

* Added a documentation substitution stanza so that texi, man
  and mdoc documents may be massaged before being finalized.

* Many, many picky warning fixes

* Section 5 man pages and mdoc pages can now be emitted
  with the templates.  They still need work, though.

* The enumeration and bitmask management templates are now rigged
  so they work in the build tree without autogen being installed.

New in 5.17 - December 2012

* Bit Map and Enumeration templates are now fully integrated.
  They have their own section in the texi docs and the
  templates produce more easily used output.

* Guile adjustments.  Early 2.0.x Guile fiddles the
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable, causing problems when you are
  trying to run programs that use not-yet-installed libraries.
  The LD_LIBRARY_PATH is now preserved.

New in 5.16 May 2012

* AutoGen now supports the "-MP" option.  The "phony" rule generated
  in the make dependency file will remove all generated files, except
  for the dependency file itself.  Please see the docs for "-MF".

* "break", "continue", and "return" macros implemented.
  "return" works in included templates and invoked macros (user defined
  macros).  "break" and "continue" work within "for" and "while"
  loops, though they cannot be used to leave invoked or included
  templates.
