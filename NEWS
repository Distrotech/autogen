New in __CURRENT_VERSION__ - May, 2005

* Update to libtool 1.5.18
* add "arg-range" text to the generated man pages

New in 5.7 - April, 2005

AutoOpts:
* "libopts" handles stand alone configuration file processing.
  Use the functions configFileLoad, optionGetValue, optionNextValue
  and optionUnloadNested.

* AutoOpts values can contain nested values, a la "getsubopts(3C)".
  The syntaxes recognized are:
  * that of getsubopts (except you do not specify which are acceptable
    and values may be quoted)
  * that of a config file (newline separated name/value pairs, per
    traditional configuration file formatting)
  * xml style where the associated values are marked with either of:
      <val-name>...</val-name>
      <named-no-value/>

New in 5.6.6 - February 2005

AutoOpts:
* "pathfind" is now incorporated into libopts, if not natively supported
* "options.h" and "usage-txt.h" are installed into an "autoopts" subdir.
* "for-each" main procedures can handle the arguments/input lists in
  several different ways, by calling the callback function with:
  * whatever the argument was
  * with the argument, after verifying it is really a file
  * with an fopen-ed file pointer to the file
  * with a pointer to the contents of the named file
  This is documented in the docs and generated man pages for programs
  that use it.

AutoGen:
* AutoGen macros were added for inserting definition file line numbers
  into the output files:  (def-file-line "value-name")
* autogen will no longer try to catch real time signals

New in 5.6.5 - December, 2004
* Equivalencing stacked argument options no longer has magical properties.
  "unstack-arg" is now equivalent to that old behavior.
* Equivalenced options may now be preset with rc/ini files and
  environment variables.
* ``autoopts-config ldflags'' will now emit the appropriate ``-R'' link option.
* autoopts.pc will now be produced and installed
