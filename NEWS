New in __CURRENT_VERSION__ December 2012

* Bit Map and Enumeration templates are now fully integrated.
  They have their own section in the texi docs and the
  templates produce more easily used output.

* Guile adjustments.  Guile inserts /usr/local/lib into the
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable, causing problems when you are
  trying to run programs that use not-yet-installed libraries.
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH is now discarded.  :(

* The AG_OTEST_GUILE_VERSION will now try "rpm -q" first
  before dpkg, "guile-config --verision" and "guile --version".

* If a "min" count value has been specified, the emitted code will
  now verify that the option appears that minimum number of times.

New in 5.16.2 August 2012

* Coverity cleanups
* evade Guile issue on BSD platform.
* avoid emitting non-error messages to stderr

New in 5.16 May 2012

* AutoGen now supports the "-MP" option.  The "phony" rule generated
  in the make dependency file will remove all generated files, except
  for the dependency file itself.  Please see the docs for "-MF".

* "break", "continue", and "return" macros implemented.
  "return" works in included templates and invoked macros (user defined
  macros).  "break" and "continue" work within "for" and "while"
  loops, though they cannot be used to leave invoked or included
  templates.

* texi documentation generation has been much improved.
  Please see the "Option Sectioning Comment" documentation.

* AutoOpts supports a "die-code" attribute.  It will generate code
  for "die", "diev" and "fserr" functions that will print a farewell
  message and die.

* a keyword option value of "-1" or "~0" now means "largest value".
