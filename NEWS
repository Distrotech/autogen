* XML character encodings are parsed in config files, thus
  <opt-name>...&lt;...</opt-name> yields "...<..."

* exit codes are enumerated for auto-opts projects
  They will appear in an enumeration in the header file and
  in generated documentation.

* program documentation templates have been improved.  See docs.

* packaging information
  The PKGDATADIR and --with-packager... information are now
  compiled into the option structure.  This makes it possible for
  config file searches to look in ${PKGDATADIR} by using "$@/"
  as the lead part of a "homerc" name.  e.g.
     homerc = "$@/config";
  will look for a file named "config" in that directory.
  "help" and "version" information will now include any
  --with-packager stuff.

New in 5.11.5 - December 2010

* When "columns" puts a special prefix on the first line, it now
  tests to see if it is longer than the indentation.  If so, that
  first prefix has the line separator, new line and indentation
  strings appended to it.
* Fixed a fence post bug triggered by creating temporary strings
  8160 through 8163 bytes long.
* dependency output files should be readable by everyone.
