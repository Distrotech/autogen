New in __CURRENT_VERSION__ October 2006

* AutoOpts code presumed that there were no #defines for the option
  names.  You can now force aside such conflicts.
* AutoOpts generated code unconditionally #includes limits.h and stdint.h.
* aliased pointer cleanups should allow higher optimization of code.
* The installation of the tear-off libopt library is now optional
  to the installers of client projects.

New in 5.8.5 July 2006

* ag-fprintf will now allow you to emit text into a suspended output stream.
* string tables have been implemented as a scheme function.  This makes it
  very easy to produce an array of characters containing NUL termintaed
  strings and have these string offsets (indexes) available for indexing into
  the string arrays.
* The libopts code will omit Windows-unfriendly code if the compile defines
  _WIN32 and does not define __CYGWIN__.
* suffix specifications in the pseudo macro may now construct an output
  file name format string using scheme code, a la:

    [= autogen5 template
    h=(string-append (getenv "TMPDIR") "/%s-hdr.h")  =]

  The "%s" will still be replaced by the base name.
* the scheme function "version-compare" will allow you to compare
  two dotted version numbers.  These can be your own versions or
  that of autogen.  The scheme variable ``autogen-version'' has been
  around for a long time and may be used as one of the arguments.
* #assert is now active in definition files.  If the text begins
  with a back quote, it is handed off to the shell for processing.
  If an open parenthesis, it is handed off to Guile.  If it is
  anything else, it is ignored.
