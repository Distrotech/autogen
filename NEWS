New in __CURRENT_VERSION__ June 2011

* Several more changes to keep Guile from "fixing" (breaking) strings.

* AutoOpts now uses string tables instead of individual static char const's.

* AutoOpts now supports vendor-opt attribute to auto-implement the "-W"
  option for POSIX specified utilities

* fiddle man page generation to facilitate mdoc man pages.

New in 5.12 June 2011

* man page templates have been regularized so it is now easier to
  use doc-section stanzas in the option definition files.

* The Guile interface glue layer has dropped Guile version 1.4 and
  has coelesced around pre-1.7 vs. 1.7-and-later interfaces, yielding
  only two forms for each interface.

* The new licensing scheme is now used in the distributed templates.

New in 5.11.8 March 2011

* *Really* cope with Guile version number 2.0.
  Some interfaces were "accidentally" removed between
  version 1.9 and 2.0.  Oops.

* AutoOpts argument types of "time and date" have been added
  to the current support for time duration.

New in 5.11.6 February 2011

* Cope with Guile version number 2.0

* packaging information
  The PKGDATADIR and --with-packager... information are now
  compiled into the option structure.  This makes it possible for
  config file searches to look in ${PKGDATADIR} by using "$@/"
  as the lead part of a "homerc" name.  e.g.
     homerc = "$@/config";
  will look for a file named "config" in that directory.
  "help" and "version" information will now include any
  --with-packager stuff.
