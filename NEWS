New in __CURRENT_VERSION__ November 2007

* integer number arguments may now have their values suffixed with
  one of the letters k/K/m/M/g/G/t/T to signify scaling by powers
  of 1000 (lower case) or 1024 (upper case).  Specify, "scaled".

* AutoOpts "arg-type" may now be set to "file".  Existence of the directory
  portion of the name will be checked.  The existence (or not) of the actual
  file may also be checked.  Finally, the file may be pre-opened with either
  "fopen(3C)" or "open(2)".

* The "columns" program now accepts a "--fill" option to cause it to fill
  text instead of filling columns.

* The tests should no longer indirectly reference installed versions of
  the binaries.  They should all work out of the build directories.

New in 5.9.3 - October 2007

* libopts requires strsignal, so the config test has been moved.
* fixed ``--save'' option bug
* programs may now choose to have config files kept in cannonical form
  ("C" locale), even if long option names are translated.  The option
  definition file must contain ``no-xlate = opt-cfg;'' or
  ``no-xlate = opt;''  See the documentation for details.

New in 5.9.2 July 2007

* GNU GPL v3 is now emitted with the "gpl" and "lgpl" functions.
* 
The most work was done for AutoOpts:

* usage.tpl template has been added.
* getopt.tpl uses this template for constructing its usage string.
* if "short-usage" or "full-usage" can be used to specify the form
  of the usage text:
  * not supplied -> compute it at run time
  * supplied, but empty -> use "usage.tpl" to compute it
  * is a variable name -> insert into option structure
  * is text -> emit the text and point to it from option structure
