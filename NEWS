New in __CURRENT_VERSION__ August 2012

* Coverity cleanups
* evade Guile issue on BSD platform.
* avoid emitting non-error messages to stderr

New in 5.16 May 2012

* AutoGen now supports the "-MP" option.  The "phony" rule generated
  in the make dependency file will remove all generated files, except
  for the dependency file itself.  Please see the docs for "-MF".

* "break", "continue", and "return" macros implemented.
  "return" works in included templates and invoked macros (user defined
  macros).  "break" and "continue" work within "for" and "while"
  loops, though they cannot be used to leave invoked or included
  templates.

* texi documentation generation has been much improved.
  Please see the "Option Sectioning Comment" documentation.

* configuring with --disable-static should now pass make check

* AutoOpts supports a "die-code" attribute.  It will generate code
  for "die", "diev" and "fserr" functions that will print a farewell
  message and die.

* a keyword option value of "-1" or "~0" now means "largest value".

* much improved .texi documentation templates.

* de-tabbed "here strings" may have output lines prefixed with tabs
  by backslash escaping the first tab to output.

* -Werror may be appended by "=warn-group".  That is accommodated now.

* many warning fixes and CamelCase name removals
