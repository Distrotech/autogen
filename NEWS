New in 5.5 - December 15, 2002
* The FOR macro will now accept a list of values, as in:
  [= FOR v IN one, "two , part" three =]
* snprintfv-0.99f was fully incorporated, saving 300K of distribution
  space and a lot of configure time.
* The 'dne' function will accept "-d" as the first argument in order
  to suppress the date from the output.

New in 5.4.8 - December 10, 2002
* Freed AutoOpts from libguile.  It was never really dependent.
* new snprintfv library incorporated

New in 5.4.4 5.4.3 and 5.4.2
* The libopts.tar.gz file is now installed
* Miscelleaneous option state saving bugs were fixed
* man page templates were cleaned up
* .texi-isms were removed from usage output
* a GCC aliasing bug was fixed.

New in 5.4.1
* Improved the configurability of the libopts tear-off library.

New in 5.4
* should have bumped to 5.4 with the release of xml2ag.
  AutoOpts documentation and usage text now uses the copyright.eaddr value
  as the "send bug reports to" address.
  AutoGen command line options may now be embedded in template and definitions
  files.  The template files support the scheme function (set-option "..."),
  and definition files support the directive, "#option ...".

New in 5.3.8
* xml2ag was added.  This is a wrapper program that will convert
  XML documentation into AutoGen definitions and pass them through
  to autogen.  It accepts all the AutoGen command line options and
  passes them through, too.

New in 5.0
* Template expressions were made simpler and much more powerful.
  An expression may be AutoGen defined values, shell scripts,
  Scheme expressions, or the latter two formatted with an
  AutoGen definition value.  AutoGen now depends on Guile.
