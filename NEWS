* getopt.tpl template is fixed to not require the internal header
  autoopts/autoopts.h.
* MAXPATHLEN will use _MAX_PATH on Windows platforms
* new libopts configuration option: --disable-optional-args This will #define
  NO_OPTIONAL_OPT_ARGS in config.h and cause the built library to ignore the
  OPTST_ARG_OPTIONAL bit in an option descriptor.  autoopts generated code
  compiled with NO_OPTIONAL_OPT_ARGS #defined will never have that bit set in
  the option descriptors either.  If libopts has been so configured, then the
  installed options.h header will contain: #define NO_OPTIONAL_OPT_ARGS 1 so
  that client code will generally be compiled with that flag set.
  The OPTST_ARG_OPTIONAL bit is ignored regardless.
* Fixed up --load-opts environment variable processing.  You can
  now correctly suppress config file loading with either:
    PROGRAM_LOAD_OPTS=no
    PROGRAM=--no-load-opts
* added new auto-supported option, --usage.  It is incorporated
  by specifying ``usage-opt;'' in the option definitions file.
* libopts now uses several exit codes from sysexits.h:
  EX_NOINPUT  (66) - a specified config file cannot be found
  EX_SOFTWARE (70) - libopts error - please file a bug report
  EX_CONFIG   (78) - a NULL option descriptor was passed in - user bug

* a script for producing Debian packages is included
* including of templates and definitions now works more like
  ``#include "foo"'' instead of ``#include <foo>''.
* fixed sizeof(int) != sizeof(size_t) bug.
* fixed incorrect argument number format string
