* GREP is now a configurable.  (Sheesh!)
* options with hierarchical structure (nested values) had some
  bugs in the config file parsing code.  Fixed.
* Since YACC is not used any more, it is no longer required. :)

* --short-help/-h is now a standard option.  See stdoptions.def.
* fixed a value referencing bug in enumeration arg handling
  (seen on platforms where sizeof(int) != sizeof(void*)).
* fixed some issues caused by extraordinary space optimizations
* cope with the fact that you cannot directly capture the return
  code in setjmp from a longjmp invocation. 8-O !!
  viz., int res = setjmp(&ctx); is illegal.
