New in 4.5.5
* Finally, really, finished the portability issues and it now
  included a complete implementation of the printf family of
  formatting routines.
* Templates for client program man pages and invoking chapters
  for texinfo docs are supplied.  They are also used by the
  autogen/columns/getdefs programs that come in this package.

New in 4.5
* Compiles with cygwin tools, provided you link GNU regex.
* *Much* enhanced portability.  AutoGen really should compile in
  just about any POSIX environment.
* Overhauled the configuration to help programs which want to use
  autoopts from Makefiles.

New in 4.4
* Massively reworked the template parsing in preparation for
  beguiling AutoGen.
* Deleted an ugly shell/awk program and replaced it with
  an ugly C program for extracting definitions from comments. :)

New in 4.1
* Two new string generation functions for creating shell-rule
  quoted strings ("xx...\t") and raw strings ('xxx\nxx')
* single quoted strings in the template macros are now
  processed the same way as in the definitions file.

New in 4.0
* The autoopts package works without the source tree in place.
* Makefile.in is regenerated with automake-1.2
* complete rewrite of the macro definitions.
* changed the code emission and expression processing
  to handle the new data structures
* added another expression function (JOIN)
* changed shell commands to run in a shell server instead
  of starting a new shell each time.  *MUCH* faster.

New in 3.2
* Ported to Digital Unix (AXP).
* ubiquitous bugfixes
* autoconfiscated with automake 1.2
