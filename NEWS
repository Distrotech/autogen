* libopts requires strsignal, so the config test has been moved.
* fixed ``--save'' option bug
* programs may now choose to have config files kept in cannonical form
  ("C" locale), even if long option names are translated.  The option
  definition file must contain ``no-xlate = opt-cfg;'' or
  ``no-xlate = opt;''  See the documentation for details.

New in 5.9.2 July 2007

* GNU GPL v3 is now emitted with the "gpl" and "lgpl" functions.
* 
The most work was done for AutoOpts:

* usage.tpl template has been added.
* getopt.tpl uses this template for constructing its usage string.
* if "short-usage" or "full-usage" can be used to specify the form
  of the usage text:
  * not supplied -> compute it at run time
  * supplied, but empty -> use "usage.tpl" to compute it
  * is a variable name -> insert into option structure
  * is text -> emit the text and point to it from option structure

New in 5.9.1 May 2007

* getopt.tpl template is fixed to not require the internal header
  autoopts/autoopts.h.
* MAXPATHLEN will use _MAX_PATH on Windows platforms
* new libopts configuration option: --disable-optional-args This will #define
  NO_OPTIONAL_OPT_ARGS in config.h and cause the built library to ignore the
  OPTST_ARG_OPTIONAL bit in an option descriptor.  autoopts generated code
  compiled with NO_OPTIONAL_OPT_ARGS #defined will never have that bit set in
  the option descriptors either.  If libopts has been so configured, then the
  installed options.h header will contain: #define NO_OPTIONAL_OPT_ARGS 1 so
  that client code will generally be compiled with that flag set.
  The OPTST_ARG_OPTIONAL bit is ignored regardless.
* Fixed up --load-opts environment variable processing.  You can
  now correctly suppress config file loading with either:
    PROGRAM_LOAD_OPTS=no
    PROGRAM=--no-load-opts
* added new auto-supported option, --usage.  It is incorporated
  by specifying ``usage-opt;'' in the option definitions file.
* libopts now uses several exit codes from sysexits.h:
  EX_NOINPUT  (66) - a specified config file cannot be found
  EX_SOFTWARE (70) - libopts error - please file a bug report
  EX_CONFIG   (78) - a NULL option descriptor was passed in - user bug

New in 5.9 March 2007

* a script for producing Debian packages is included
* including of templates and definitions now works more like
  ``#include "foo"'' instead of ``#include <foo>''.
* fixed sizeof(int) != sizeof(size_t) bug.
* fixed incorrect argument number format string
