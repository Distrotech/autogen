* ATTRIBUTE_FORMAT_ARG is a configured attribute that wraps
  __attribute__((__format_arg__(n))) procedure declaration attributes.
  To configure it, the ag_macros.m4 has a new macroo,
  AG_COMPILE_FORMAT_ARG (which is a compile only test probe).

* Auto-edit Guile headers that depend upon configure values
  most especially:  noreturn
  but check for "ptrdiff_t" in our configure too, so that Guile does
  not create its own duplicate definition.

* Abort from the failing function so that stack traces are useful
* The libopts m4 configure code must configure the libopts/Makefile
* Happy 2014 New Year
* make sure library option handling code does nothing when the
  library is just trying to get information about an option.
* Only apply texi2mdoc when it is needed.
* The aoGetsText() emitted i18n helper function needs its argument
  to have the "format_arg" attribute.
