"This program extracts autogen definitions from a list of source files.";

detail =
"Definitions are delimited by the patterns:\n
    `/\\*=[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]*[ \\t][ \\t]*[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]*\\n'
    `=\\*/'.\n
The first name is the block name and the second is the block entry
name.  This creates a definition of the following form:

    #line nnn \"source-file-name\"
    block_name = {
        name = entry_name;
        ...
    };\n
The elipsis '...' is filled in by text found after the `/*=' line
and before the `=*/' line, with leading `^[^*]*\\*\\**[ \\t]*' removed
from each line (or all text if an asterisk is not found).

`ordering' is, by default, alphabetical by the entry name.
    Use, `no-ordering' if order is unimportant.
    Use `ordering' with no argument to order without case sensitivity.
    Use `ordering=file-name' if chronological order is important.
    getdefs will maintain the text content of `file-name'.
    `file-name' need not exist.

`subblock' is used to create shorthand entries for subblocks.
    For example, with `subbl=arg=argname,type', the text:
    `arg: this, char *' will then expand to:
    `arg = { argname = this; type = \"char *\" };'.

`autogen' is the default output, which is to say by default
    the output is written to a pipe that an autogen process is
    reading for definitions.  You may optionally specify a particular
    autogen program.  You may alternately specify `output=file'
    to cause the definitions to be written to a file.

`template' specifies a particular template for the definitions to use.
    If not specified, it defaults to the base-name argument.
    If that is not specified, then it tries to find a name string
    from the `defs-to-get' argument.  Failing that, it will use
    the name of the current directory.

`templ-dirs' and `base-name' are passed on to the autogen process.";
