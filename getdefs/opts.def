/* * * * * INFO DOC DESCRIPTION * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * */

prog_info_descrip = <<_EOF_
This program extracts AutoGen definitions from a list of source files.
Definitions are delimited by `/*=<entry-type> <entry-name>\n' and `=*/\n'.
From that, this program creates a definition of the following form:

@format
    #line nnn "source-file-name"
    entry_type = @{
        name = entry_name;
        ...
    @};
@end format

The ellipsis `...' is filled in by text found between the two delimiters,
using the following rules:

@enumerate
@item
Each entry is located by the pattern "\n[^*\n]*\\*[ \t]*([a-z][a-z0-9_]*):".
Fundamentally, it finds a line that, after the first asterisk on the line,
contains whitespace then a name and is immediately followed by a colon.
The name becomes the name of the attribute and what follows, up to the
next attribute, is its value.
@item
If the first character of the value is either a single or double quote,
then you are responsible for quoting the text as it gets inserted into
the output definitions.
@item
All the leading text on a line is stripped from the value.
The leading text is everything before the first asterisk,
the asterisk and all the whitespace characters that immediately
follow it.  If you want whitespace at the beginnings of the lines
of text, you must do something like this:

@example
 * mumble:
 * "  this is some\n"
 * "  indented text."
@end example

@item
If the `<entry-name>' is followed by a comma, the word `ifdef'
(or 'ifndef') and a name `if_name', then the above entry will appear as:

@example
#ifdef if_name
#line nnn "source-file-name"
entry_type = @{
    name = entry_name;
    ...
@};
#endif
@end example

@item
If you use of the @code{subblock} option, you can specify a nested
value, @xref{getdefs subblock}.  That is, this text:

@example
 * arg:  int, this, what-it-is
@end example

with the `--subblock=arg=type,name,doc' option would yield:

@example
arg = @{ type = int; name = this; doc = what-it-is; @};
@end example
@end enumerate
_EOF_;
