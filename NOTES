Each page is filled with tiny structs:

	* configure.in (AC_SUBST): Calculate the glob match for
	agFun*.c in the src directory here (see below) and substitute
	with AGFUN_SOURCES.
	
	* src/Makefile.am (agfunc.def): Removed agFun*.c dependency,
	as it is not valid (and breaks ground up maint-rebuild). 
	Substitute for AGFUN_SOURCES instead.  I left the rule itself
	using a glob expression so that maintainer additions will
	be picked up in the rule even though the dependency won't notice.
