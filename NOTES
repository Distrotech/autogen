If you are reconfiguring this product, you _must_ use
the config/bootstrap script.  The standard "configure"
script is edited to produce a working script.  Specifically,
this product will not build correctly when the source
and build directories are different.  The following
text is inserted at the beginning of the configure
script:

        top_builddir=`pwd`
        top_srcdir=`echo $0 | sed 's@/[^/]*$@@'`
        top_srcdir=`cd $top_srcdir && pwd`
        if test "$top_srcdir" = "$top_builddir" ; then : ; else
          ( cd $top_srcdir
            find . -type d -print ) |
          grep -v '/CVS\|/RCS' |
          while read f
          do test -d $f || mkdir $f
          done

          ( cd $top_srcdir
            find . -type f -o -type l -print ) |
          grep -v '/CVS\|/RCS\|~$\|,v$\|/#' |
          while read f
          do
             test -f $f || ln -sf $top_srcdir/$f $f
          done
          sh ./configure $@
          exit $?
        fi

This script basically turns the build directory into a symlink
copy of the source directory.

As a consequence of this, doing a "make distcheck" will fail.
It will fail because the distcheck process makes a distribution
from a tree where this process has _not_ been done.
