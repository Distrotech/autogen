	* pkg/libopts/README: corrected spelling of check macro & documented
	the automake conditional that is also generated.
	* pkg/libopts/mklibsrc.sh: correctly emit the documented substitution
	variable.  The doc was ahead of the code. :-)  Also, reworked the
	contents of MakeDefs.inc file.  It contains LIBOPTS_REDIST giving the
	list of files that client programs need to redistribute.

2003-02-05  Bruce Korb  <bkorb@gnu.org>

	* autoopts/test/equiv.test: Some seds leave no space at
	the start of the line.  Accommodate.
	* pkg/libopts/mklibsrc.sh: Accommodate systems without gzip

2003-02-04  Bruce Korb  <bkorb@gnu.org>

	* agen5/test/heredef.test: quote the heredoc marker and compare
	the output with a sample output.
	* agen5/test/shell.test: document known failures on BSD-derived systems
	* agen5/tpParse.c: use uintptr_t instead of off_t
	* autoopts/agman1.tpl: replace @emph and @strong, too
	* getdefs/gdinit.c: constrain file name list reading to non-tty input
	* getdefs/getdefs.c: aesthetic cleanup
	* getdefs/opts.def: update copyright date and version and add an
	explanation about reading file names from stdin.
	* doc/auto_gen.tpl(autogen.texi): hunt for the file, do not assume
	the source directory.
	* getdefs/bootstrap.dir: remove debugging "set -x"

2003-02-03  Bruce Korb  <bkorb@gnu.org>

	* config/confmacs.tpl(try-withlib): rewritten and now generates
	substitution variables LIBXXX_CFLAGS and LIBXXX_LIBS
	* config/misc.def(libguile): use new feature
	(libxml2): ditto
	* agen5/Makefile.am: adapt to new names generated by conftest.tpl
	* autoopts/Makefile.am: ditto
	* autoopts/test/Makefile.am: ditto
	* xml2ag/Makefile.am: ditto
	* configure.in(uintptr_t): check for it
	* agen5/autogen.h:  replaced off_t with uintptr_t, since that's
	the way it is used anyway.
	* getdefs/getdefs.h(zAttribRe): allow attribute names to be hypnenated
	* agen5/expString.c: changed some doc comments to not conflict with
	the new getdefs usage
	* agen5/opts.def(include): BSD does not define RTLD_NOW, but does
	suggest using DL_LAZY.  Therefore, now #define the former to latter.

2003-01-12  Bruce Korb  <bkorb@gnu.org>

	* agen5/Makefile.am(defParse.c): remove explicit rule 'cuz automake
	provides it, but make all objects depend on the header 'cuz you cannot
	specify a single object (defLex.o).
	* agen5/expFormat.c: warning fix
	* agen5/funcFor.c: ditto
	* agen5/loadPseudo.c: ditto
	* autoopts/aginfo.tpl(invocation): add debugging info until cause of
	failure has been determined!!
	* autoopts/enumeration.c(optionEnumerationVal): warning fix
	* autoopts/pgusage.c(doPagedUsage): sanity check
	* autoopts/test/shell.test: sort env output for testing consistency
	* config/confmacs.tpl(try-withlib): add "lib" to the cache variable
	* snprintfv/compat.h(HAVE_WCHAR_T): only use wchar_t if we have it
	(HAVE_WINT_T): ditto
	* snprintfv/*: eliminate accommodations for K&R.  K&R is dead.

2003-01-05  Bruce Korb  <bkorb@gnu.org>

	* autoopts/usage.c(optionUsage): set option_usage_fp to stdout when
	the exit code is EXIT_SUCCESS, otherwise use stderr.  Use throughout.
	* autoopts/enumeration.c: send usage output to "option_usage_fp"
	* autoopts/makeshell.c: ditto
	* autoopts/optmain.tpl: ditto (for generated keyword options)
	* autoopts/pgusage.c: ditto
	* autoopts/test/defs(compile): do not redirect stderr for help text
	* autoopts/test/equiv.test: verify that PAGER redirection works
	* autoopts/test/guile.test: send 'guile starts' string to stdout, too.

2003-01-04  Bruce Korb  <bkorb@gnu.org>

	* autoopts/*, agen5/*: Rework the memory allocation after valgrind
	analysis & get "MEMDEBUG" working again.
