'\fBAutoGen\fP is a tool designed for generating program files that contain
repetitive text with varied substitutions.  Its goal is to simplify the
maintenance of programs that contain large amounts of repetitious text.
This is especially valuable if there are several blocks of such text
that must be kept synchronized.
.PP
One common example is the problem of maintaining the code required for
processing program options.  Processing options requires a minimum of
four different constructs be kept in proper order in different places in
your program.  You need at least: The flag character in the flag
string, code to process the flag when it is encountered, a global
state variable or two, and a line in the usage text.
You will need more things besides this if you choose to implement
long option names, rc/ini file processing, environment variables
and so on.

All of this can be done mechanically; with the proper templates and this
program.';
