#  There are five different things we need to examine:
#
#  1.  That the autogen internal string.
#  2.  What we expect that string to contain.
#  3.  What is generated as the "C" representation
#  4.  What is generated for raw shell strings
#  5.  What is generated for "cooked" shell strings
#
#  We will compare all these things by generating a C program that
#  will test the various strings and a shell script to invoke the
#  program with the two shell string formats for arguments.
#  The program will also write out the expected string value.
#  That value will be compared with what autogen wrote out
#  as its internal value.
#
#  All this stuff must be generated carefully.
#  Specifically, the '${testname}' expressions need to
#  be expanded in certain parts of the output file.
#  In those areas, the eof marker must *not* be quoted.
#  In other places (e.g., where defining the strings),
#  rather than hassle with understanding shell quoting rules,
#  instead we *will* quote the EOF marker to avoid
#  any shell interpretation at all!!
