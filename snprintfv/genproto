# Commentary:
#
# USAGE: genproto [debug] <filter> source.h-in > source.h
#
# This program scans a C source file for special comments preceding
# K&R function declarations, and generates PARAMS() wrapped, and commented
# function declarations suitable for use in a header file.
#
# See the accompanying README for details of how to format function headers
# for extraction by this script.

# Code:

if test "X$1" = Xdebug; then
  set -x
  shift
else
  # cleanup temporary files on exit, hangup, interrupt, quit or terminate
  trap 'rm -f genproto.*.$$' 0 1 2 3 15
fi

if test $# -lt 2; then
  echo "USAGE: genproto <filter> source.h.in > source.h" >&2
  exit 1
