 *
 * This function looks in all the specified directories for a configuration
 * file ("rc" file or "ini" file) and processes any found twice.  The first
 * time through, they are processed in reverse order (last file first).  At
 * that time, only "immediate action" configurables are processed.  For
 * example, if the last named file specifies not processing any more
 * configuration files, then no more configuration files will be processed.
 * Such an option in the @strong{first} named directory will have no effect.
 *
 * Once the immediate action configurables have been handled, then the
 * directories are handled in normal, forward order.  In that way, later
 * config files can override the settings of earlier config files.
 *
 * See the AutoOpts documentation for a thorough discussion of the
 * config file format.
 *
 * err:  Returns the value, "-1" if the option (config file) descriptor
 *       is out of date or indecipherable.  Otherwise, the value "0" will
