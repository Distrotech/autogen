	* autoopts/makeshell.c
	Developed a special "TEST_MAIN" procedure putShellParse
	which emits a portable shell script that will parse the
	arguments from the definition file.  There is some
	functionality that it cannot do, however :(

	* columns/*
	New program to columnize a list of text.
	* autoopts/opthead.tpl
	The OPT_VALUE_* macro must be cast to an int, not t_word.
	* doc/auto_gen.tpl
	recoded to look for files named */*.menu and include those
	entries in an add-on chapter.
	* getdefs/getdefs.texi
	Renamed it to getdefs.tpl and now generate both getdefs.texi
	and getdefs.menu.  The latter file contains solely a section
	menu entry.
	* getdefs/opts.def
	Added documentation strings for each option.
	* src/agShell
	Added some code to make clearer what may have failed,
	should the shell command go away or abend.

	* autoopts/Makefile.am
	* autoopts/opthead.tpl
	* autoopts/autoopts.texi
	* autoopts/options.tpl
	* doc/Makefile.am
	* doc/auto_gen.tpl
	* getdefs/getdefs.c
	* getdefs/opts.def
	* src/agGetDef.c
	* src/agShell.c
	* src/opts.def
	* src/Makefile.am
	Did a *whole* bunch of stuff to eliminate distribution of
	doc/autogen.def.  The entire documentation is now extracted
 	directly from source files, instead of relying on intermediates.
	More work that it was worth.

	* src/agGetDef.c
	Fixed stdin file allocation bug.

	* src/agShell.c
	* src/opts.def
	Added debug option 'show-shell' to display the commands to stderr.
	I still cannot figure out why the shell sometimes dies when
	autogen reads its definitions from stdin.  :(

	* src/agExpr.c
	Fixed the name of the definitions file for the _DNE function.

	* src/Makefile.am
	Hacked the creation of opts.[ch] such that -DDEBUG is set
	whenever 'DDEBUG' is found in the $(CPPFLAGS).

	* autoopts/Makefile.am
	* autoopts/autoopts.texi
	* doc/Makefile.am
	* src/agGetDef.c
	* src/agShell.c
	* tests/Makefile.am
	* tests/opts.test
	Fixed distribution problems (schitzophrenic directories)

1998-09-14  Bruce Korb <korbb@datadesign.com>
	* */*
	Corrected most of the problems engendered by below :-}

1998-08-21  Bruce Korb <korbb@datadesign.com>
	* src/*
	Reworked most everything to separate the  template parsing from
	the text emission.  A massive data structure now points to all
	the pieces.  This data structure should be fairly easy to
	beguile.  It was why I did it :).
