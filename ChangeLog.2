	Did a *whole* bunch of stuff to eliminate distribution of
	doc/autogen.def.  The entire documentation is now extracted
 	directly from source files, instead of relying on intermediates.
	More work that it was worth.

	* src/agGetDef.c
	Fixed stdin file allocation bug.

	* src/agShell.c
	* src/opts.def
	Added debug option 'show-shell' to display the commands to stderr.
	I still cannot figure out why the shell sometimes dies when
	autogen reads its definitions from stdin.  :(

	* src/agExpr.c
	Fixed the name of the definitions file for the _DNE function.

	* src/Makefile.am
	Hacked the creation of opts.[ch] such that -DDEBUG is set
	whenever 'DDEBUG' is found in the $(CPPFLAGS).

	* */*
	Corrected most of the problems engendered by below :-}

	* src/*
	Reworked most everything to separate the  template parsing from
	the text emission.  A massive data structure now points to all
	the pieces.  This data structure should be fairly easy to
	beguile.  It was why I did it :).
