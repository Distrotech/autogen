This is the build instructions for autogen.  If you're viewing it with
Emacs, try doing Ctl-C Ctl-t and browsing through the outline headers.
Ctl-C Ctl-a will unfold them again.

** Building from a release tarball

If you have downloaded a release tarball,

   configure; make; make install

should do it. The usual configure options are available, notably inckuding
the --prefix option.  The generated Makefile inckludes both "install" and
"uninstall" instructions.

** Building from a repository clone

To build from a repository clone, you must first have gperf (the GNU
Perfect Hash Function Generator) installed). Then run

   bootstrap

in the top-level directory.

** Known issues

(esr) There are three remaining issues that I know of:

1. Whatever's going on with local-install

2. autogen requiring itself to build i problem we need to solve.
   The standard way to solve this is check in its build products,
   then rebuild those only when the ef or *tpl files change. Of
   course the INSTALL file needs to explicit about which stuff is
   generated 
3. I'm goino want an easy, documented way to produce a *static*
   build outogen so I can experiment with NTP builds without
   colliding with an older shared library.  bkorb replies:
   '"cd $top_builddir/agen5 ; rm autogen ; make LDFLAGS=-static"
   will do what you ask.'.
