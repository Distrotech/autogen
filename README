This is AutoGen, an automated text file generator.  It was inspired
out of frustration and hassle with maintaining syncronization between
option flag lists, global variables and usage information.  The desire
for more than #define macros came about when it became apparent that
macros alone were insufficient for reducing the maintenance into a
single option list.  The impetus to actually start something finally
came when I had to maintain a large callout procedure table and
associated lookup tables.

Rev 1 of this utility was a set of #define macro expansions.
Rev 2 was a shell script that sort-of did a prototype.
      Much better than just #defines, but still clearly lacking.
Rev 3 had a very kludgy macro definition syntax.
Rev 4 a reworking and simplification of the declarations
Rev 5 (?) the addition of Guile expression processing

AutoGen requires a POSIX regular expression library, and an ANSI C
compiler to build correctly.  Use the --with-regex-prefix and
--with-regex-lib, or the --with-included-regex  options to autoconf if
it cannot otherwise locate a suitable library.


Note to SCO/OS5 users:
	This product uses libtool.  It apparently behaves incorrectly
	in the presence of gcc and consequently needs to use /bin/cc.
	Configure this program with:

		CC=/bin/cc ./configure

Note to HP/UX users:
	The native regex library is pretty sucky (on 10.20 at least) so
	you should link with a better regex lib, such as the included
	one:

		./configure --with-included-regex

	If you use the native c compiler, you must put it in ANSI C mode
	with:

		CFLAGS=-Ae ./configure
